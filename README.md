# Smart Resume Analyzer

## Overview

Smart Resume Analyzer is a Flask-based web application that analyzes resumes and ranks them against job descriptions. It uses a combination of **NLP models**, **ATS heuristics**, and **LLM-based suggestions** to provide insights such as:

* ATS Friendliness Score
* Section completeness (Education, Experience, Skills, etc.)
* Extracted skills from resume text
* Detailed resume summary (generated by LLM)
* Actionable suggestions to improve the resume
* Job role prediction
* Resume ranking against a Job Description (JD)

---

## Features

1. **Resume Analysis**

   * Extracts text from PDF resumes.
   * Detects sections (Education, Experience, Skills, Projects, etc.).
   * Calculates ATS Friendliness Score based on formatting and completeness.
   * Provides LLM-generated summary, suggestions, and predicted job role.

2. **Job Description (JD) Ranking**

   * Matches multiple resumes against a given JD.
   * Uses sentence-transformer embeddings for semantic similarity.
   * Combines skill match, semantic similarity, and ATS score into a weighted final score.

3. **Skill Extraction**

   * Dictionary-based matching using a curated dataset of 50,000+ skills.
   * Extracted skills are highlighted for each resume.
